com.openssh.sft.plist is a launchd configuration to set up a bare SFTP server
on TCP port 2299 localhost-only for USB use. It's nice for relatively fast music
syncing and file transfer under Linux (and it avoids encryption). Con: it gives
anyone with usb access root FS access on the phone, as well as anything running
on the phone itself.

Use it with a command like this:

IPATH=/var/mobile/Media
MOUNTPOINT=$HOME/media/iphone
$ sshfs localhost:$IPATH $MOUNTPOINT -o workaround=rename -o directport=2299 \
	-o kernel_cache -o entry_timeout=30 -o attr_timeout=30

Make sure you run tcprelay.py:
$ python tcprelay.py -t 2299

Remember that to bypass the stupid new iTunesDB hash you need to edit
/System/Library/Lockdown/Checkpoint.xml and change DBVersion to 2.
